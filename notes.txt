We are using .htaccess in /app  so that we are unable to access the .app folder in the browser.

---1.1
Because of the following line of code
RewriteRule  ^(.+)$ index.php?url=$1 [QSA,L]
in public/.htaccess
when pass a url param into our url we don't need knowlmvc/index.php?url=WHATEVER
instead we can just pass it in as follows knowlmvc/WHATEVER

Side obvious Note. All of our controllers in our controllers dir will be classes.
